    <p>I am a sophomore at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA majoring in Journalism with minors in Business and Entrepreneurship. I am a sports finatic and die hard New York Giants fan with a passion for photograpy and writing. As I am very interested in how everchanging the communications industry is, I am seeking experience in the marketing and advertising field in hopes to be a part of this digital revolution. I have a wide variety of interests, from sports to lifestyle writing to how the print industry is changing so when it comes to what I would like to do after graduation, I'm open to many opportunities. I am currently seeking internships in marketing and advertising in the Greater New York City area and hope to work with a company where I can offer a millennial consumer perspective to help them further their brand. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/madison-welker-34132711b">Here is my LinkedIn page</a> </p>
