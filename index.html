<p> I am a sophomore at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA majoring in Journalism with minors in Business, Marketing and Entrepreneurship. I am a sports fanatic, die hard New York Giants fan and a lover of photography and writing. It's an exciting time in media and I'm very interested in finding new and innovative ways to connect with the world through multiple channels. Everything is changing, technology is booming - we're in a digital revolution.</p>

   
<p> I have a wide variety of interests. I think the word "passion" is often wrongly used in showing that one is diverse opposed to showing what one genuinely gets excited about. So, I'd say I'm less passionate and more of an excited person as I definitely get excited about a lot (sometimes too many things). I am a couch potato all day on Sunday to watch football, I try my hardest to continue with my athletics after deciding not to play a college sport, I love to take photos of my food before I eat it no matter how much attention it will draw to my table at a restaurant. I enjoy being passionate about what I do because hey, if you're going to do it, why not be excited? 
So, here is a look at some things that get me excited! </p>

   <p> As a Journalism student, I'm beginning to have more published work that I'm excited to share. Below is some of articles, posts and more that I've written since being at Lehigh. </p>

<a id="My-Visualizations" class="anchor" href="#My-Visalizations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Visualizations</h3> 

<p>Below are examples of data visualizations I made while taking a DataViz class at Lehigh. As studies show, having visualizations to supplement a story allows a reader to comprehend the data and pull their own conclusions from the numbers instead of being told through words. The semester long course taught me the power of visuals and how they can really enhance your work. From working with Tableau to Google Fusion Maps, I've been exposed to many platforms that allow me to really bring a story to life through graphics - Take a look!
