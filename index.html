<p> I am a sophomore at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA majoring in Journalism with minors in Business, Marketing and Entrepreneurship. I am a sports fanatic, die hard New York Giants fan and a lover of photography and writing. It's an exciting time in media and I'm very interested in finding new and innovative ways to connect with the world through multiple channels. Everything is changing, technology is booming - we're in a digital revolution.</p>

   
<p> I have a wide variety of interests. I think the word "passion" is often wrongly used in showing that one is diverse opposed to showing what one genuinely gets excited about. So, I'd say I'm less passionate and more of an excited person as I definitely get excited about a lot (sometimes too many things). I am a couch potato all day on Sunday to watch football, I try my hardest to continue with my athletics after deciding not to play a college sport, I love to take photos of my food before I eat it no matter how much attention it will draw to my table at a restaurant. I enjoy being passionate about what I do because hey, if you're going to do it, why not be excited? 
So, here is a look at some things that get me excited! </p>

   <p> As a Journalism student, I'm beginning to have more published work that I'm excited to share. Below is some of articles, posts and more that I've written since being at Lehigh. </p>
   
   <p> Below is my Brown and White Profile, Lehigh's student-run school paper. This past semester I served as the assistant sports editor and next semester I will be heading over to the lifestyle side to be the assistant lifestyle editor! </p>

   <p> I've always appreciated how much university's value club sports programs so for my feature story for a journalism class, I wrote about the Women's Club Soccer Team and how the women feel they benefit from being on the team. <p/>

   <p> For an entry level Journalism class, I created a blog dedicated to music I listen to around campus - you'll always catch me with headphones in! </p>

 <a id="My-Data-Visualizations" class="anchor" href="#My-Data-Visualizations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Data Visualizations</h3>
 
   <p> In order to stay on top of the ever-changing dynamic of journalism, journalists need to find way to keep people engaged; without readers and viewers, there is no such thing as journalism. Not to say its a dying business, but the shifts entering the work field have been mended with those in the fields’  understanding of technology, innovation and leveraging new emerging businesses to aid them in this technological paradigm. </p>
   
   <p>Below are examples of data visualizations I made while taking a DataViz class at Lehigh. As studies show, having visualizations to supplement a story allows a reader to comprehend the data and pull their own conclusions from the numbers instead of being told through words. The semester long course taught me the power of visuals and how they can really enhance your work. From working with Tableau to Google Fusion Maps, I've been exposed to many platforms that allow me to really bring a story to life through graphics - Take a look!</p>
